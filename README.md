# Telegram ü§ù GTK4 Color palette

A Telegram Desktop theme I am creating to provide the users of GNOME DE some consistency.


- [Always up-to-date theme](https://t.me/addtheme/libadwaita_dark)

- [Telegram Group](https://t.me/adwaita_dark)

Please, if you want to help me developing the theme, tell me the naming of the element you want me to work on. This can be done by entering the theme editing menu and searching by keywords the needed element. Then you create an issue here and tell me what's wrong with the element.

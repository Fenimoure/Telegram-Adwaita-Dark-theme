# Telegram ü§ù GTK Color palette

Please note that this was just created and is now being in development. 

This is basically what we do here. We try to make Telegram look good and consistent with all the other GNOME apps waiting for the Telegrand client to be fully developed and fully functional which will be very cool! 

If you have any ideas, or you want to help us creating this, you are welcome! I did not find any files which contain the colors GNOME uses in its apps so you may want to install the [GNOME color picker extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3396/color-picker/) to choose the colors from the other GNOME apps. 

There is also a different ["libadwaita"](https://t.me/addtheme/libadwaita) Telegram theme, but I think it looks worse than this one.

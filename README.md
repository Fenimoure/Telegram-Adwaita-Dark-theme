<h1 align="center"> Telegram ü§ù GTK3 Color palette</h1>

This is basically what we do here. If you are eager to using only the official Telegram client, but want it to look somewhat consistent with all the other apps, you are welcome to use this theme. I regularly update the theme and fix problems with it. You can always create an issue with your suggestions on how to make this theme better. 

If you have any ideas, or you want to help us creating this, you are welcome!
